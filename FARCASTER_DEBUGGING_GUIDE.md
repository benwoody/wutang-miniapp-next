# Farcaster Wallet Debugging Guide

## 🔍 Enhanced Debugging Added

I've added comprehensive console logging to help identify exactly where the Farcaster wallet transaction is failing. The debugging will show detailed information at each step of the process.

## 📋 How to Debug the Issue

### 1. **Open Browser Developer Tools**
- In Farcaster app, open the frame
- Open browser developer tools (F12 or right-click → Inspect)
- Go to the **Console** tab

### 2. **Attempt to Mint**
- Generate a Wu-Tang name
- Click "Mint as NFT" button
- Watch the console output carefully

### 3. **Console Output Analysis**

The debugging will show detailed logs for each step:

#### **Step 1: Wallet Detection**
```
🔍 Starting Farcaster wallet detection...
🔍 Getting Farcaster context...
🔍 Farcaster context: [object]
✅ In Farcaster environment with client and user
🔍 User details: [object]
🔍 Client details: [object]
```

#### **Step 2: Wallet Provider**
```
🔍 Calling sdk.wallet.getEthereumProvider()...
🔍 Farcaster wallet provider result: [object]
🔍 Provider type: object
🔍 Provider keys: [array]
✅ Successfully got Farcaster wallet provider
```

#### **Step 3: Provider Testing**
```
🔍 Testing provider with eth_accounts...
🔍 Provider accounts: [array]
🔍 Testing provider with eth_chainId...
🔍 Provider chainId: 0x1f90
✅ BrowserProvider created successfully
```

#### **Step 4: Network Configuration**
```
✅ Step 1 complete: Wallet provider obtained
🔍 Step 2: Checking network and getting config...
✅ Step 2 complete: Network config obtained: [object]
```

#### **Step 5: Signer**
```
🔍 Step 3: Getting signer...
✅ Step 3 complete: Signer obtained
```

#### **Step 6: Transaction Creation**
```
🔍 Step 4: Calling mintWuTangNFT...
🔍 Starting mintWuTangNFT function...
🔍 Contract address: 0x18f2589406bda8202C979F5d9c79400d16Ff25C5
🔍 Getting signer address...
🔍 Signer address: 0x...
🔍 Creating contract instance...
🔍 Calling contract.mintNFT...
✅ Transaction created successfully!
🔍 Transaction hash: 0x...
```

## 🚨 Common Failure Points to Look For

### **Issue 1: Context Missing**
```
❌ Not in Farcaster context or missing client/user
🔍 Context client: false
🔍 Context user: false
```
**Solution**: App not opened in Farcaster properly

### **Issue 2: Wallet Provider Invalid**
```
❌ Farcaster wallet provider invalid or missing request method
🔍 Provider request method type: undefined
```
**Solution**: Farcaster wallet not properly initialized

### **Issue 3: Provider Test Failure**
```
❌ Provider test failed: [error]
```
**Solution**: Wallet provider doesn't support required methods

### **Issue 4: Network Issues**
```
❌ Please switch to Base network. Supported networks: Base Mainnet (8453) or Base Sepolia (84532). Current: 1
```
**Solution**: Wrong network, need to switch to Base

### **Issue 5: Contract Call Failure**
```
❌ Error in mintWuTangNFT: [error]
❌ Error message: [specific error]
```
**Solution**: Contract interaction failed

## 📝 What to Report

When you test the minting, please share:

1. **Complete console output** from the moment you click "Mint as NFT"
2. **Where exactly it fails** (which step shows an error)
3. **Any error messages** that appear in red
4. **Network information** shown in the logs
5. **Whether the Farcaster wallet opens** at all

## 🔧 Temporary Testing Mode

You can also test with testnet by adding `?testnet=true` to the URL:
```
https://your-app.vercel.app/?testnet=true
```

This will use Base Sepolia testnet for testing without real ETH.

## 📱 Expected Behavior

If working correctly, you should see:
1. All green checkmarks (✅) in console
2. Farcaster wallet opens with transaction details
3. After confirming, immediate success message
4. Button changes to "Already Minted"

## 🚀 Next Steps

Once you run the test and share the console output, I can:
1. Identify the exact failure point
2. Implement a targeted fix
3. Test the specific Farcaster wallet integration issue

The enhanced debugging will pinpoint exactly where the communication with Farcaster wallet is breaking down.
